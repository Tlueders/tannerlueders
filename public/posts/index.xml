      <description>After working as a Software Engineer for the last ~8 years, and specifically a DevOps engineer the last five, I have grown a large interest in self-hosting, homelabs, and security. This has lead me down the path of spinning up VM&amp;rsquo;s, clusters and tooling here and there to solve temporary individual needs and exploration.
Additionally, outside of tech, I am into other hobbies like photography and gaming. After a decade of taking photos, I have built up quite the archive of images.</description>
